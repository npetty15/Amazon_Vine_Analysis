## Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this review is to see if it would be an advantage for SellBY to participate in the Vine program within Amazon. This program is one in which a small fee and products are provided to Amazon Vine members to test and review products. In this review I choose to look at videogames to determine if the Vine program would be an advantage for SellBy to particpate in. 

This was completed by pull data from readily available datasource on the Vine program and breaking this down into paid and unpaid reviews

## Analysis Results

  1) How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
  
    - Vine reviews totaled 94
    
    - Non-Vine totaled 40,471
    
  2) How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
  
    - 5-star Vine Reviews totaled 48
    
    - 5-star non-Vine reviews totatled 15,663
    
   3) What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
   
    - Percentage of 5-star Vine Reviews is 51.1%
    
    - Percentage of 5-star non-Vine reviews is 38.7%
    
## Summary

It appears that there may be a positivity bias in the data for paid videogames. The amount of 5-star reviews in the much smaller selection of paid reviews is close to 12 points higher than the unpaid reviews. These amounts should be much closer. It might be plausiable that paid Vine members are apt to rate videogames better then the non-Vine members. 

An additional review we can do with this is to checkout another type of products, such as office supplies or homegoods to see if the positivity bias is present accross multiple product lines.

I could also looks to see what the breakdown is per star, for example is there a bigger allotment of 4-star review, or what are the 1-star reviews saying. I beleive seeing the spread of reviews accross the star ratings will enlighten the SellBy management.
